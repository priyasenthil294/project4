Kim Seok-jin (Korean: 김석진; born December 4, 1992), known professionally as Jin (진), is a South Korean singer, songwriter, and member of the South Korean boy band BTS. Jin has co-written and released three solo tracks with BTS: "Awake" in 2016, "Epiphany" in 2018, and "Moon" in 2020, all of which have charted on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart.
 In 2019, Jin released his first independent song, the digital track "Tonight". He made his official debut as a solo artist in October 2022, with the release of the single "The Astronant"
 Jin was scouted by Big Hit Entertainment for his looks while walking down the street[9]—he was studying acting at the time and had no background in music[10]—and subsequently auditioned as an actor for the company before becoming an idol trainee.[11] On June 13, 2013, he made his debut as one of the four vocalists in BTS.[12] Under the band's name, Jin has performed three solo songs: "Awake", "Epiphany", and "Moon". "Awake", which he co-produced, was released in 2016, as part of BTS' second Korean studio album Wings.[10] The song peaked at number 31 on the Gaon Digital Chart and number six on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart in the United States.
  He shared a Christmas version of "Awake" for free on SoundCloud that December.
