Artistry
Rolling Stone's Brian Hiatt describes Jungkook as "an extraordinarily soulful tenor".
 Kim Min-sook, writing for the Korean music website Reputation, described his voice as "soft" and suitable to sentimental songs, also praising his ability to keep a stable intonation even while dancing, while Mary Siroky of Consequence observed that he "has the kind of clear, dexterous voice built for pop music"
 Health
In 2017, Jungkook collapsed during a BTS concert in Chile.[100] During the band's Love Yourself World Tour in 2018, he suffered a heel injury which prevented him from participating in choreography.
 He did not withdraw from the subsequent European leg of the tour, but sang while seated.
 Impact and influence
In a 2019 survey conducted by Gallup Korea, Jungkook ranked as the third most-loved celebrity of the year in South Korea. 
He debuted on the list in 2016 at 20th, placing 17th in 2017 and eighth in 2018. Jungkook placed first for 10 consecutive weeks on magazine Hi China's list of the most beloved celebrities in China in 2018.
 Various artists have cited him as an influence and role model, such as Kim Dong-han and Hyeongseop X Euiwoong.
